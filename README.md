## üíµ a gold investment dApp üíµ
</div>


**Auric** is a decentralized application (dApp). Its main currency is an ERC20 token named `Auric`, which (supposedly) represents ownership of an actual quantity in gold bars.

The process of purchasing and redeeming Auric tokens is handled by the `AuricSeller` smart contract.

<br>

## üîß Functions

### ü™ô Purchase Auric tokens

By connecting your Ethereum wallet app, you can purchase *Auric for ETH*. The notion is that by purchasing Auric, **you invest in gold, without the need to actually have it in your possession** or even stored in a remote vault.

### üí¥ Claim Gold Bars

If you want the (supposed) actual gold bars delivered to you, you can "claim" them. It is a *3-step* process:

- **Step 1** is where you **authorise** the AuricSeller smart contract to handle your Auric tokens on your behalf.


- **Step 2** is where you **return** the tokens to the issuer.


- **Step 3** is where you **receive a QR** code representing the transaction. The QR code (along with proof of your crypto account ownership, e.g. a signed message) can be used to claim the gold bars *(the verification act is outside the scope of this dApp)*.


The AuricSeller smart contract also includes a function for the owner to **claim the ETH** that was used to purchase gold *(the owner's claim ETH function is not featured on this dApp)*. By claiming, 5% of profits is **automatically donated** to a predefined address (e.g. a charity).

## üóÉÔ∏è What's Included?

This repository contains a **Hardhat project** and a **Next.js dApp**:

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è The Hardhat project includes **two Solidity smart contracts** *(located inside the `/contracts` folder)*:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Auric**, the ERC20 token that represents gold bars

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **AuricSeller**, the contract that handles the exchange and redemption of Auric tokens<br/><br/>


‚û°Ô∏è The Next.js frontend/dApp (located inside the `/auric-dapp` folder) is the way to interact with the smart contracts, which have been deployed to the Sepolia test network.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. First, you need to **clone this repository** and **install its dependencies**:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/kimonkekes/Auric.git
    cd auric-dapp
    npm install
    ```
    
2. Once installed, you can **run the frontend** with:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    
3. Finally, **open** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser. In order to connect to and interact with the dApp, you will need to have **a crypto wallet installed with some SepoliaETH available** for your transactions.
